How to create rest APIs

POST
create an user with id next id
return 200 return the created user


PUT/PATCH
David prefers PUT over PATCH- patch is not ment to be used to create objects!


- to create non-existing id
- to update, existing id

/pet
- should return owner id

/person/1/pets - all users pets
/person/1/pets/2 - returns a user's pet

ways of connecting pet and owners:
- person has an array of pet ids
- array of objects (?)
